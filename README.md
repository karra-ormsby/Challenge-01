# Challenge-01

##Description

Given starter code for a Horiseon website, I have modified it to fit better with accessiblility standards, and made sure that all links are working as intended. I have also made the code easier to follow for someone new coming to the code, through semantic HTML, consolidating and organzing the CSS file, and adding comments where neccessary.

##Installation

N/A
No installation needed. The code is deployed as a stand alone page on Git Pages. (add link to delpyed site here)

##Usage

The website is the homepage for a company Horiseon. You can use the navigation bar at the top right of the page ![image of the navigation bar](./assets/images/Nav%20bar.png) to navigate to a specific section if so desired ![where the navigation bar links to](./assets/images/What%20the%20Nav%20bar%20links%20to.png), or you can just view the page as a whole.
